# Blockchain Secret Storage

🚀 Super Cool Contract

## Description 🚀

The contract helps anyone create Storage Units on the blockchain. 📦

Each storage unit can hold any text and numbers which can be added to individual storage units. 📝

Storage units can have read price which is a price set when creating and allows the owner to tax
users of the storage unit to pay when reading the information, for the owner reading is free (except for gas). 💰

The storage units can be sold and bought for a price set when auctioned which transfers the ownership to the buyer. 🛒

Units that are not auctioned remain completely private which allows the owners to keep the private Id and Password
to himself to share the id and password if someone wants to see the content after paying (if the read price is set). 🔒
